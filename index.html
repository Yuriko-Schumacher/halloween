                    What is the most Popular Halloween Candy?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The year of 2020 is passing by so fast, and before we know it, it'll be Halloween!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found this data set put together by <b>FiveThirtyEight</b>, for the project <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/" target="_blank">The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am analyzing this data set because trick or treating is such an interesting part of American culture, and I'd like to know more about popular American candies.

According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/" target="_blank">the project's article</a>, <b>FiveThirtyEight</b> conducted an experimental survey where people are randomly presented two Halloween candies (out of 85 different kinds) and asked to choose the one they prefer.

                            On the other hand, fruity flavored candies and hard candies are among the least popular on average. If you are thinking to invent a new candy, it would be risky to make it hard or fruity flavored. I'm going to visualize this analysis <a href="#avg-win-rate">later</a> in the project.

                            First, I'm going to visualize the candies' win rates. Since the analysis above shows chocolate candies are the most popular on average, I'm going to visualize how many candies have the "chocolate" attribute, and where they are located in the ranking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To do that, I'm going to create an ordered bar chart.

                        Each bar represents each candy's win rate. The visualization above shows higher-ranked candies tend to contain chocolate.

                    <p>
                        The visualization below, created similarly, shows the win rate ranking and whether each candy contains fruity flavors.

                            In the <a href="#type">analysis</a> above, we learned that whether a candy has chocolate or not affects its average win rate the most, compared to other candy attributes such as fruity flavors and crispiness.

                        <p>
                            Now, I'm going to create a Cleveland dot plot to visualize how average win rate varies among different candy attributes.

                        The visualization above reassures that the greatest average win rate difference is determined by whether or not a candy includes chocolate. It also shows that crispy candies have an even higher average win rate than chocolate ones.

                    <p>
                        If we look at row "Chocolate", we can say chocolate is almost essential to a candy's popularity. On the other hand, if we look at row "Crispy", we can say that the absence of crispiness doesn't affect its popularity as harshly as the absence of chocolate. Rather, crispiness makes a popular candy more popular on average.
